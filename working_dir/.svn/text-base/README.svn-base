Genome Simulation Platform (GSP)

OVERVIEW

This simulation platforms main purpose is to be used to help genomic 
researchers build an efficient genomic network.

REQUIRED TOOLS
1) Download GT-ITM (Sketchy ~ Best to use version included here)
2) Download Boost Graph Library
3) Download GNU Scientific Library
4) Download Simgrid

CONFIGURATION
1) Linux & Unix
  - Unpack tar.
  - In Makefile:
    - Change -L to where Simgrid/lib is located
    - Change -I to SimGrid/include is located
    - Change -I to BGL/include is located
    - Change -I to GSL/include is located

2) Mac & Windows
  Don't try it. =)
