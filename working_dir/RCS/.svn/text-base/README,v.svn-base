@Genome Simulation Platform (GSP)

OVERVIEW

This simulation platforms main purpose is to be used to help genomic 
researchers build an efficient genomic network.

REQUIRED TOOLS
1) Download GT-ITM (Sketchy ~ Best to use version included here)
2) Download Boost Graph Library
3) Download GNU Scientific Library
4) Download Simgrid

CONFIGURATION
1) Linux & Unix
  - Unpack tar.
  - In Makefile:
    - Change -L to where Simgrid/lib is located
    - Change -I to SimGrid/include is located
    - Change -I to BGL/include is located
    - Change -I to GSL/include is located

2) Mac & Windows
  Don't try it. =)

FILES
1) headers
  bgl_graph_info.hpp - Boost Graph Library Header information
  randvars2.hpp - Gnu Scientific Library Headers
  routing.hpp - Routing.cc Headers
  simgrid.hpp - Simgridd.cc Headers (Simulation Headers)
  types.hpp - Main Headers + Classes
2) source
  file_format.cc - GT-ITM code handler + dot conversion
  main.cc - Handles main flow of program
  randvars2.cc - GSL calls
  routing.cc - Handles BGL routing code
